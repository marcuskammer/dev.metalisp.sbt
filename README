** Introduction

A Common Lisp library for generating Bootstrap-based HTML markup. It provides
macros to easily create Bootstrap components such as accordions, alerts,
badges, buttons, cards, dropdowns, headers, list groups, navbars, nav-tabs,
pagination, and tables. This library is dependent on the Spinneret library for
HTML generation.

The following components are available as packages:

- accordion :: This package provides macros for generating Bootstrap Accordion
  components. Accordions are collapsible lists of items, each of which can be
  "expanded" or "collapsed" to reveal or hide content.

- alert :: This package offers macros for creating Bootstrap Alert components.
  Alerts are used to provide user feedback, usually in response to user
  interactions, such as form validation or actions.

- badge :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Badge
  components. Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. They can be
  used to add additional information to an element, such as a count.

- button :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Button
  components. Buttons are used for actions, like submitting forms or initiating
  actions.

- card :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Card components.
  Cards are flexible and extensible containers for displaying content in a
  structured format.

- dropdown :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Dropdown
  components. Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying
  lists of links and actions in a dropdown format.

- list group :: This package provides macros for generating Bootstrap List
  Group components. List groups are flexible and powerful components for
  displaying not only simple lists of elements, but complex ones with custom
  content.

- navbar :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Navbar
  components. Navbars are responsive meta components that serve as navigation
  headers for your application or site.

- nav / tab :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Nav
  components. Navs are navigation components that can be styled in different
  ways and can contain links, text, or any other kind of content.

- pagination :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Pagination
  components. Pagination is used to let the user navigate through a set of
  discrete pages.

- table :: This package provides macros for generating Bootstrap Table
  components. Tables are used to present data in a tabular format.

- spinner :: This package provides macros for creating Bootstrap Spinner
  components. Spinners are used to indicate a loading state of a page or a
  section.
