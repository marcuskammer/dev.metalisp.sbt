;; A card is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for
;; headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors,
;; and powerful display options. If youâ€™re familiar with Bootstrap 3, cards
;; replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those
;; components is available as modifier classes for cards.
