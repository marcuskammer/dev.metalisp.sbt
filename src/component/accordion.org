This example demonstrates how to integrate the cl-sbt/accordion macros into a
web application to create an interactive accordion component. The macros help
generate the necessary HTML structure for the accordion, which allows users to
navigate through content conveniently.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have included the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries in
   your HTML. Also, include the Spinneret library for HTML generation.

2. Define your web application package and import the necessary packages,
   including cl-sbt/accordion.

3. Implement the `generate-accordion-page` function. This function generates an
   HTML page with an accordion using the cl-sbt/accordion macros.

4. Call the `generate-accordion-page` function within your application's logic
   to generate the HTML page with the accordion.

5. Bootstrap's JavaScript library will handle the expansion and collapse
   animations of the accordion content, providing an interactive user
   experience.

By using these macros, you can easily create accordion components that allow
users to navigate and view content in a user-friendly manner within your web
application.
