* Introduction

Questionnaires are powerful tools for gathering information and insights from
users. They are crucial for understanding user behaviors, preferences, and
requirements. This document will demonstrate how to build a web-based
questionnaire using the cl-sbt/questionnaire macros in a Common Lisp
application.

** The Importance of Questionnaires

Questionnaires help in collecting data for various purposes including market
research, user experience study, and many more. They can be in multiple formats
like single-choice, multiple-choice, or open-ended questions.

*** Types of Questions

- Single Choice: Questions that allow one answer.
- Multiple Choice: Questions that allow multiple answers.
- Text: Open-ended questions for free text input.

* Integrating dev.metalisp.sbt/component/questionnaire Macros

To create a questionnaire in your Common Lisp web application,
cl-sbt/questionnaire macros can be employed. These macros generate the HTML
required for different types of questions in a questionnaire.

#+name: questionnaire-page
#+begin_src lisp :results output file :file-ext html
  (defpackage my-web-questionnaire-app
    (:use :cl)
    (:import-from :dev.metalisp.sbt :with-page)
    (:import-from :dev.metalisp.sbt/pattern/questionnaire :questionnaire)
    (:export :generate-questionnaire-page))

  (in-package :my-web-questionnaire-app)

  (defun generate-questionnaire-page ()
    "Generates an HTML page with questionnaires using questionnaire macros."
    (with-output-to-string (spinneret:*html*)
      (with-page (:title "Questionnaire Example" :main-con t)
        (questionnaire "/submit"
          (:ask "How old are you?"
           :group "age"
           :choices (:radio "18-24" "25-34" "35-44" "45-54" "55+"))
          (:ask "Gender"
           :group "gender"
           :choices (:radio "Male" "Female" "Non-binary" "Prefer not to say" "Other" :text "Other"))
          (:ask "How many hours per day, on average, do you spend browsing the internet?"
           :group "webbrowsing"
           :choices (:radio "Less than 1 hour" "1-3 hours" "3-5 hours" "5+ hours"))
          (:ask "What are your favorite brands?"
           :group "brands"
           :choices (:checkbox "Brand A" "Brand B" "Brand C" "None" :text "Other"))
          (:ask "How often do you shop online?"
           :group "shopping"
           :choices (:radio "Daily" "Weekly" "Monthly" "Rarely" "Never"))
          (:ask "Which of the following devices do you own?"
           :group "devices"
           :choices (:checkbox "Smartphone" "Laptop/PC" "Tablet" "Smartwatch" "None"))
          (:ask "What is your preferred method of payment for online purchases?"
           :group "payment"
           :choices (:radio "Credit/Debit Card" "PayPal" "Bank Transfer" "Cash on Delivery" "Cryptocurrency"))
          (:ask "Which social media platforms do you use regularly?"
           :group "socialmedia"
           :choices (:checkbox "Facebook" "Twitter" "Instagram" "LinkedIn" "TikTok" "None" :text "Other"))
          (:ask "How do you usually consume news?"
           :group "newsconsumption"
           :choices (:radio "Online News Websites" "Social Media" "Television" "Newspapers/Magazines" "Radio" "None"))))))

  (format t (generate-questionnaire-page))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: questionnaire-page
[[file:questionnaire-page.html]]

This example demonstrates the integration of the cl-sbt/questionnaire macros into a
web application. The macros assist in generating the required HTML for
different types of Bootstrap questionnaires.
